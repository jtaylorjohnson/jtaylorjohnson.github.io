Ever since I was 9 years old, I have had a deep interest in technology. I was always the go-to tech person for friends, family, and even my school. Computers have always fascinated me and held my interest like no other. I have never lost interest in all of these years, even though I decided to focus on other subjects as I progressed through my education. I even took a computer science course in high school, which introduced me to how programming works.

I look back and wonder what kept me away from further pursuing the path of programming. Regardless, I finally came to a turning point in my life when I realized I needed to alter course. Learning to code has always been in the back of my mind and I am so exited to finally be able to jump into it head first.

I enjoy how logical programming is and how you can create something from nothing. I love that becoming a software engineer means I will be able to do something I truly enjoy while creating brand new useful things and also make a great living while doing it!
