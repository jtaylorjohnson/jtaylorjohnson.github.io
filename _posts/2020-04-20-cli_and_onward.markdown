Creating this CLI program from nothing was a great experience. I still have plans grinding away in my head on all the ways I could change it and improve it. I know if I gave it more time I’d make it even better. But the experience of legitimately building my first running app from nothing and to have it do something kind of cool. 

Just by pulling up my little app on my command line and simply entering a city, I can quickly find out the current weather conditions in that city. It’s not the most inventive and wasn’t the hardest thing I could have done, but I think it’s helped to ignite a second spark in me and I’m thirsty for more.
